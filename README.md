## Usage
When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the user is given a prompt to choose a password length between 8-128 characters. (if their answer is not an acceptable number, they will be given an alert that lets them re-read the prompt.)


The user will then choose if they want lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters to be included.


When the user completes all prompts, the password will be displayed based on their choices!
